- Any person or team requests an AWS account and it is available in minutes
- Accounts are configured with security best practices by default, and remain compliant
- Everything anyone does on the account is tracked, and can be monitored
- Teams change, resulting in changes to access to AWS. People change roles, resulting in changes to access to AWS. All such changes can be reflected accurately and for large numbers of users and accounts
- Such changes are reflected quickly, in terms of corresponding access and permissions on AWS accounts 
- Users that are responsible for financial control for some set of AWS resources have visibility to cost and usage information for the corresponding AWS accounts (and only those accounts) 
- (Regardless of who pays for consumption on the account,) users are both aware of practices for responsible usage of resources, and able to act upon such guidelines
  - the prescriptive approach: 
    - Only specified products can be deployed
    - Resources that are not in use are de-provisioned
  - normative approach:
    - Standard products are available, users may customise these further, and extend these with new kinds of resources
    - Users have access to accounts that allow them to experiment broadly
- Resources not in use are de-provisioned. Users publish some metric that indicates when resources are in use.
- It is easy and straightforward to use "products" for my needs that are being improved to take advantage of best practices
